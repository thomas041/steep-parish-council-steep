					<h3>Steep Parish Plan Working Parties</h3>
					
					<p>The <a href="http://www.steepvillage.com/ppindex.html" target="_new">Steep Parish Plan</a> was published 
					in late 2012 and is now the responsibility of the Parish Council.</p>
					<p>As defined in the Parish Plan action plan, working parties have now been set up and are chaired by councillors. 
					The first working party, to review Steep Common, met in 2012 and their report can be 
					read <a href="./pcfiles/2012 Steep Common Review.pdf" target="blank">here</a>. The working party comprised:
						<ul>
							<li>Cllr. Jim MacDonald (Chair)</li>

							<li>Rev. John Owen</li>
							<li>Jessica Pocock</li>
							<li>Nik Baker (Governor, Steep Primary School)</li>

					<h3>Affordable Housing site assessment.</h3>
					<p>Following on from the well-attended Parish Council meeting on 16 July 2015, 
					the draft minutes of which are available 
					<a href="./pcfiles/SPC-july16th15-mins-draft.pdf" target="blank">here</a>,
					the Parish Council has now assembled a small group of councillors 
					and community volunteers to look at all the possible sites in the parish for a modest development of affordable housing 
					and to make recommendations to the Parish Council. Such a development emerged as one of the key priorities in the Parish Plan 
					and the Council has now resolved to launch a systematic site search. This exercise is expected to last between six and twelve months 
					and will involve working with the South Downs National Park Authority and other key agencies, as well as public consultation.</p>
					<p>The Terms of Reference and membership of this working party can be viewed <a href="./pcfiles/AHWP-TOR.pdf" target="blank">here</a>.</p> 
					<h3>Other working parties.</h3>
					<p>Two other working parties are currently operating; Planning &amp; Development - the members are:
					Peter Cruttenden, Jim MacDonald and Jenny Martin; and Resilience - Graeme Fairley. </p>
					<p>A document outlining the other working parties, their objectives and leaders can be found
					<a href="./pcfiles/pp-working-parties.pdf" target="blank">here</a>.</p>
