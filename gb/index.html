					<h3>Statutory Review &#45; SDNPA Local Plan</h3>
					<p> The First Local Plan for the South Downs National Park was adopted by the National Park Authority on 2nd July.
						As explained in earlier up&#45;dates, the new plan incorporates the Church Road site next to the Village Hall and
						opposite the Mill Lane junction within the settlement boundary for the village.   It has been identified by
						SDNPA as having the potential for between 8 and 12 houses.
					</p>
					<p>The largest part of the site is in the trusteeship of the Steep in Need Charity and a smaller portion belongs
						to the Village Hall (also a Charity &#45; the Steep War Memorial Village Club).  The Parish Council had discussed
						the topic recently and re-affirmed its wish to ensure that there should be the best possible community consultation
						on any proposals for this important site in the heart of the village.
					</p>
					<p>Following the adoption of the plan, we had intended to hold an initial public consultation event on 26th October
						in conjunction with the two charities.  However, it has come to light that a legal challenge has been lodged
						against the Local Plan by a local resident.  Until this judicial review process has run its course, we do not
						think it is appropriate to proceed with the planned consultation.
					</p>
					<p>	We will keep residents informed of future developments.
					</p>
